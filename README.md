# Global-Women's-Inequality-Project
This project explores, makes inferences, and models women's inequality comparing different regions across the globe. The associated economic data was found from the World Bank Group, while the measures of women's inequality was found from the United Nations. I used their Gender Inequality Index, which has numerous measures for both male and female statistics. 

Under the "Figures" directory, you will find saved pngs of the images I created.
